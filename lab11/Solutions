Part 1: GDB

	4.  	The error is occurring on line 89.

	6.  	The problem is malloc was not used to allocate memory to the variable int.
			To fix, insert pt = malloc(sizeof(*pt)); before the loop is executed.

	9.		break zeroDist

	12.		delete 1
			c


Part 2: Valgrind

	2.		Yes, 16,000,096 bytes.

	3.		Lines 41, and 93.

	4.		Add free(zero_pt); before return d;
			Add free(pt); before return 0; in main

Part 3: Profiling

	1.		The program runs at ~1 sec with 7,000,000 iterations
			Default arg:	0.15 sec

	4.		Free
			Rand
			Main
			zeroDist
			dist

	6.		Line 31, change pow() to sqrt()
			Change all doubles to floats

	8.		Runtime with optimizations is now 0.7 sec
